                        Chelsea McGuire Kester is the president and founder of JADON Events. Chelsea is an OSU alumni
                        with a degree in Advertising and PR. She is also a TCC Business Model Launch Program alumni
                        (2012) and the recipient of a 2012 Tulsey Award for Young Entrepreneur of the Year for her work
                        with JADON Events. Recently Chelsea was elected as the 2020 Chair of TYPros. Chelsea is
                        passionate about helping local businesses and organizations connect with new potential
                        customers, donors and followers through special events. She also loves to create moments that
                        will last a life time through her social events. It is because of her passion, and her advanced
                        experience in event planning, design and marketing, that she launched JADON Events.
